      A Note from the Author

I grew up in the quiet foothills of the White Mountains in New England, where life moved slowly. No crowded streets, no constant noise — just a red house halfway up a dirt road, nestled in the trees. Back then, cell phones were rare, and the internet didn’t arrive until I was seven or eight. Most of my days were spent away from screens and stimulation — and more often than not, I was outdoors.

My parents weren’t religious. They never told me what to believe. Instead, they taught me to question everything, to seek truth through my own inquiry, and to consult multiple, verifiable sources before settling on any conclusion. I offer you the same encouragement: question everything, including this book.

I spent most of my youth alone in the woods. The trees became companions. The wind in the pines felt like conversation. Over time, nature revealed something that can’t be explained so much as felt: that everything is part of a single, interconnected rhythm. Trees, rivers, stones, animals — all moving together in quiet harmony. That realization changed me, and it never left.

Eventually, my attention turned outward — to the cosmos. Space, the stars, the sheer incomprehensibility of it all. I began to see not just connection, but oneness — a deep structure that lies beneath both scientific and spiritual understanding. Quantum physicists have discovered that particles once joined remain connected across vast distances — hinting at an underlying unity beyond time and space. Meanwhile, in ancient traditions, sages spoke of a cosmic dream, or of existence arising from the mind of God.

Whether it’s the Big Bang or the breath of Brahman, most traditions point to a single origin — a singularity, a source — from which all emerges. And that recognition led to what would become Unicosmoism: a way of living rooted in the truth that we are not separate. We are not fragments. We are the universe, momentarily appearing as people.

Unicosmoism is not a religion in the old sense — no dogma, no rigid rules, no gatekeepers. It is a gathering of souls who feel that same ancient pull: to live with love, unity, and deep reverence for all life, including our Earthly kin and our cosmic neighbours beyond this world.

The Church of Cosmic Oneness, and the Order of Unicosmoism, were founded as a sanctuary for those who’ve wandered — seekers, misfits, mystics — who longed to be part of something sacred but could never quite fit into traditional boxes. If you’ve always known, quietly, that you belong to something greater — welcome home.

This book is a reflection of that journey. Not a set of beliefs, but a mirror for what you already know deep down. May it remind you of who you truly are — and who you’ve never ceased to be.

~ Rev. C.P. Johnson


Chapter One
The Great Unfolding

We begin — not at the beginning, you see, because there is no such thing. The notion of a “beginning” is simply a convenient illusion, like drawing a line in the ocean and saying, “Here it starts.” But where would the line itself have come from?

You did not come into this world. You came out of it. Like a blossom on a branch or a ripple on the stream, you are not a stranger to the cosmos — you are its expression. Its gesture.

And yet, most of us live as if we're something else entirely — as though we were dropped here from some other place, expected to measure up to a reality we never chose. We feel the need to justify ourselves, as if life were an exam and we were perpetually under review. But I say, there is no judge. No panel behind the curtain. No celestial scorekeeper tallying up your worth.

There is only the great unfolding — this endless blooming of suchness.

You see, we imagine that we are walking on a path. But the truth is, we are the path. And it is not going somewhere. It is going. That’s all.

So pause — not to arrive, but to see. Because all of it, every beat of the heart, every flicker of thought, is Just This.

Now here’s the rub — the curious trick that got us all tied up in knots: the idea that you are a separate “self,” housed inside a bag of skin, looking out through peepholes called eyes. A sort of ghost in the machine.

But tell me — where, precisely, does you end and the world begin?

Is it at your fingertips? But what of the air passing over them? What of the light reflecting from your skin to another’s eye? You are not separate from what you observe — the observer and the observed are two faces of the same movement.

We’ve been duped, quite beautifully, into believing we are fragments. That we must compete, achieve, conquer — to matter. But this sense of separation is just a clever mask played by the universe to enjoy its own hide-and-seek.

You are not a lonely bubble floating through space. You are the very water of the sea, momentarily dancing as a wave, and then returning.

So if you wish to find yourself, stop looking. Instead — listen. Not just with your ears, but with your being. To the breeze. To the hum of silence. To the rhythm of your own breath.

Just This.
And you are it.
And so is everything else.


Chapter Two
The Still Point of Being

There comes a moment — and it may arise in the quiet of dawn, in the hush between words, or even in the middle of sorrow — where everything seems to stop.

Not in the sense of ending, but in the sense of pausing. As if the whole world took a breath... and didn’t exhale.

In that moment, one does not think life. One simply is life.

You are no longer trying to be anything. No longer trying to figure it out. There is no story to uphold, no identity to polish, no future to chase. There is only presence — naked, undressed, and whole.

This stillness is not the absence of movement, but the ground from which all movement arises. It is not made — it is noticed. Or more precisely, it is what remains when there is nothing left to hold onto.

We spend so much of our lives trying to get somewhere else — spiritually, emotionally, materially. As if there were a better now hiding just around the bend. But what if nothing is missing? What if the arrival is already here?

Just This was never a destination. It was the silence between heartbeats, the space in which all life breathes. And this still point — which you may glimpse between thoughts or behind the eyes — is not apart from you. It is you, before the name, before the story.

There is nothing to do with this awareness. One does not capture it or keep it like a possession. One falls into it, the way one falls asleep — by letting go of the effort to try.

And here’s the paradox: the stillness that seems so subtle, so easy to overlook, is the very foundation of all experience. Like the screen behind the film, or the space within the bell that lets it ring.

To rest in this is not an escape — it is a return.

And yet, the moment we try to grasp this stillness, it slips through our fingers. The mind, so clever and industrious, begins to whisper: “Ah, now I’ve got it. This is presence.” But presence is not a thing to be held. It is the holding itself.

You cannot chase stillness like a goal, nor can you simulate it with effort. The more you try, the further you seem to be from it. Because the very act of trying presumes that you're somewhere else — that you're not already what you’re seeking.

And this is the fundamental misunderstanding: the belief that awakening is an event, something dramatic, otherworldly. But it isn’t. It’s simple. It’s the recognition of what has always been here, before the chase began.

Even now, as you read these words — listen. Not just to the meaning, but to the silence between them. That space is not empty. It is alive. It is the womb of all perception. The very place where you are.

This still point, this ground of being, does not reject the world. It is not some meditative cave away from the noise of life. In fact, it includes the noise. It holds joy and sorrow alike, without clinging to either.

And when you are resting in it, you will find — quite to your surprise — that everything becomes lighter. Not because anything has changed, but because you are no longer at war with what is.

Even suffering, when met without resistance, reveals something sacred. Not in a way that glorifies pain, but in a way that dissolves the barrier between “me” and “my pain.” The one who suffers becomes transparent — and all that remains is the feeling itself, rising and falling in the open field of awareness.

There is no teacher more honest than stillness. No truth more intimate than this:
You are already home.
You always were


Chapter Three
The Fiction of Time

We speak of time as though it were real — as though it flows, moves, ticks. But what is this “time” that we keep chasing, watching, measuring? Can you touch it? Can you see it apart from the clock?

No one has ever actually experienced the past or the future. We remember, we anticipate, yes — but when does that remembering occur? When is the anticipation felt?

Now.

The mind has taken this simple immediacy — this living moment — and overlaid upon it a conceptual timeline: a past we believe to be fixed, a future we presume to approach. But these are shadows of thought, not things. Useful illusions, perhaps — like the lines on a map. But try walking on a map instead of the land, and you’ll quickly see the trouble.

The world, the real world, does not move in straight lines. It dances in spirals, ripples, and rhythms. The sun rises and sets, the seasons turn, our bodies age — yes. But all of this unfolds within the eternal now. The clock does not cause the day to pass. It only measures our concept of it.

We confuse change with time. But change is simply the nature of being — not evidence that we’re passing through some dimension called “time.” A flower blooming is not being pulled forward through an invisible tunnel. It is simply blooming. The rhythm of life is a quality, not a quantity.

And so, the very idea that we are “running out of time,” that we must “make something of ourselves,” rests on this mirage — that who we are exists as a sort of moving target on a timeline. But if there is only this, and always this, then who is the one racing? And where, precisely, is there to get?

The sense of urgency, of striving, of unfinished business — this is the ego clinging to time like a raft, terrified that the tide will leave it behind. But there is no tide. There is only the sea, and you are not the raft — you are the water.

To realise this is to be free. Not from responsibility, but from the tension of trying to become. For you see, the moment you stop trying to “live in the present,” you are already there. Because where else could you be?

And so we begin to see that time is not a thing we live within — it is a lens we’ve been taught to look through. Take it off, and the world doesn’t vanish. It deepens.

The bird on the branch is not waiting for tomorrow. The trees are not keeping schedules. They simply respond to what is — light, rain, season — not by memory, not by plan, but by being.

You too are allowed this grace.

But even as we see through time’s illusion, another habit arises — the fear that without it, nothing will get done. That we’ll drift into aimlessness or become inert without a future to chase.

Yet this fear, too, belongs to the ego — that subtle ghost always seeking certainty. It has learned to motivate itself through imagined outcomes: success, status, completion. And without a “later,” it believes it has no reason to act at all.

But must the flower bloom for a reason? Does the wind move to accomplish something?

You see, there is a kind of action that does not emerge from time-bound striving — it flows from presence. From attunement. From being so in touch with what is, that response arises naturally, like a dance to music you don’t need to control.

In this way, life is no longer a project. It becomes a response. And that response doesn’t come from thought — it comes from wholeness.

You don’t need to plan to be kind, or wait for a better moment to love. When you're rooted in the real, compassion is spontaneous. Clarity, too, becomes effortless. Not because it’s calculated — but because there’s no confusion left about what matters.

And so, without time, we do not become less. We become more alive. There’s no distance between perception and action, no inner tension between what is and what should be.

That is the real peace: not the stillness of inaction, but the harmony of not needing anything to be different than it is. And from that place — yes, things still change. But they no longer change because we fear the present. They change because change itself is life’s nature, and we are finally flowing with it, not against it.

The irony is beautiful: only when we stop treating time as real do we begin to truly live.


Chapter Four
Turning the Gaze to the Illusion of the Ego

There is something subtle — almost invisible — that follows you through each moment. It narrates, comments, measures, compares. It is not your breath, nor your heartbeat. It is the mind’s idea of who you are — a fiction so persistent, so rehearsed, that you mistake it for your very being.

This is the ego. Not the Freudian ego, not the boastful arrogance we often associate with the word, but rather the deep, habitual sense of being a separate self. A someone. A name behind the eyes.

And it gets in the way — constantly.

Because the ego cannot simply be. It must become. It must accumulate. It survives only by striving — for attention, approval, control, understanding. It wants to win arguments, be seen as spiritual, be “the one who let go” — it even wants to be the one who has no ego.

But the ego is never at peace. It is not designed for it.

You see, when life flows simply — when you are resting, walking, breathing — the ego becomes uneasy. “This can’t be enough,” it says. “There must be more to fix. Something to prove.” It’s like a little itch in the mind, whispering: You are not there yet.

And this is why it matters — not just as some lofty spiritual idea, but because ego is the source of our most persistent discontent. The anxiety of not measuring up. The fear of being judged. The shame of imperfection. These are not flaws in your being — they are shadows cast by the ego trying to defend its little kingdom.

To see this is not to condemn the ego. It is to understand it.

It was built to protect, to help you navigate a world of other egos. But it is a tool, not a truth. A mask, not a face.

And so the great undoing begins with a simple shift: noticing the ego as a movement, not as yourself.

When the thought arises — “I shouldn’t have said that,” “They don’t like me,” “What if I fail?” — you don’t fight it. You look gently and ask: Who is speaking? Who is being threatened?

You don’t find anyone.

There is no little person in your head who owns the thoughts. They arise, like clouds. They pass, like wind. And in between them — between the I’s and me’s and mine’s — is a vast, silent presence. That is who you are.

And from this presence, you begin to live differently.

You stop needing to win conversations. You no longer walk into a room wondering how you’re being perceived. You listen more. You defend less. You feel a lightness in your chest where the old armour used to sit.

You begin to act without rehearsing, love without bargaining, speak without polishing. Not because you’ve perfected yourself — but because there’s no self left to perfect.

That’s the paradox. You don’t kill the ego. You see through it. And in that seeing, its grip softens.

You override it not by force, but by remembering what’s real.

You remember that you are not an idea. You are not your role. You are not a project to complete.

You are life itself — awake, aware, and whole.

But the ego does not only appear as “I.”
It also appears as us.

It forms tribes, beliefs, ideologies — it wraps itself in flags, in doctrines, in skin colour, in history. And just as the individual ego clings to its identity, so too does the collective. It says, We are this. And they are that.

And from this illusion of separation, conflict is born.

You see it in politics. In religion. In culture. In families. Not just in the arguments themselves, but in the sense of righteousness behind them — that electric charge of needing to be right, needing to defeat the “other.” This is the collective ego in motion: the illusion that your group identity must be defended, preserved, glorified.

But the irony is this: what we call “identity” is often just fear wrapped in story. Fear of dissolving. Fear of insignificance. Fear of losing the role we’ve rehearsed so long we forgot it was a role.

To separate from this — to step outside the group dream — requires stillness.

Not silence of tongue, but silence of mind.

For when you become still, deeply still, the ego has nothing to echo against. The roles fall quiet. The story stops spinning. And in that space, you begin to see — not as “me,” not as “us,” but as presence itself.

This is not easy. The collective ego is seductive. It rewards those who conform to its story. It praises those who defend the tribe. But stillness cuts through it like a blade of clear light.

When you sit quietly, watching your thoughts without chasing them, you begin to see the movements of the ego like ripples on a pond. They come, they go. You do not have to be swept into them.

And if you can sit within your own thoughts like this — imagine what becomes possible in the world.

Imagine a world where people pause before they react. Where stillness is not weakness, but wisdom. Where clarity comes not from who speaks the loudest, but from who listens the deepest.

This is not a fantasy. It is already here — within you.

Stillness is the doorway. Presence is the path.

And ego, both personal and collective, cannot walk it

This seeing — this quiet undoing of the self-image — is not new.

Long before modern thinkers gave the ego a name, the sages of many lands were already pointing to its illusion.

The Taoists of ancient China spoke of wu wei — effortless action — not as laziness, but as the natural movement that arises when there is no ego striving to interfere. The Tao does not need to be controlled, they said. You align with it by letting go of the self that resists it.

The Hindus, through the teachings of Advaita Vedanta, offered the image of the ātman — the true self, not the mask. “You are That,” they said. Not the doer, not the thinker, not the story — but the still, witnessing presence that shines behind it all. The ego, they taught, is merely māyā — illusion — and liberation (moksha) comes not by becoming something new, but by ceasing to mistake yourself for what you are not.

The Buddha, too, saw clearly the suffering born from clinging to a self. In his silence on the question of the soul, there was a radical invitation: see what happens when you stop trying to solidify your identity. When you stop building the raft and simply cross the river.

Even among the desert mystics, the indigenous shamans, the Christian contemplatives, and the Sufi poets, you find this same deep intuition: that the self we think we are is not our final truth. That humility is not self-deprecation, but the absence of self-importance. That true clarity comes not from exalting the self, but dissolving it.

You are not the first to face this illusion. And you are not alone.

You walk a path walked by many, though none walked it quite like you will.

And so we close this chapter, not with finality, but with reverence. The gaze has turned inward. The illusion is seen. And ahead lies the living question:

What does it mean to truly live without it?


Chapter Five
Bypassing the Ego and Being Fully Here

The ego is clever. When threatened, it does not always fight. Sometimes, it bows. It takes up the language of awakening. It starts quoting sages, reading sacred texts, attending retreats — all the while whispering, “Look how free I am becoming.”

This is what many call spiritual bypassing — the subtle art of using spiritual ideas to avoid discomfort, vulnerability, or honest presence. And like all forms of avoidance, it is rooted in fear. Not the raw, honest fear that comes and goes, but the ego’s fear of dissolution.

Instead of facing the ache directly — the sadness, the confusion, the wounded places — the bypassing ego floats above them, wrapped in a thin mist of insight. It says things like “It’s all meant to be,” or “There is no self,” or “I’ve transcended that.” But if you listen closely, there’s a tension underneath — a quiet resistance to simply being with what is.

To bypass the ego, then, is not to cover it in sacred cloth. It is to meet it without flinching.

To feel jealousy rise and not pretend it's gone.
To feel fear and let it tremble in you like wind in a tree.
To feel pride flare up, and rather than shame it, simply see it — as a movement, not a flaw.

This is the work: to be fully here, without polishing, without performing.

To sit with discomfort and not need to solve it.
To walk through grief without narrating it into a lesson.
To listen to another without secretly constructing a response.

Presence, real presence, is shockingly simple. It is not exalted or detached. It does not float above life — it is embedded in it. Raw. Immediate. Undivided.

To be fully here means to let go of the one who is trying to be fully here.

It means to breathe without technique.
To open your hand without looking for something to take.
To trust that what is arising — now — is not in the way, but is the way.

And slowly, without force, you begin to notice that presence has a quality to it. Not of effort, but of intimacy. It is not distant from the world. It is the world, seen without the filter of becoming.

You do not need to find it. You only need to stop running from it.

And that is the deepest undoing: when nothing needs to be added, when no special state is sought, and you realise — even in your ordinariness — that this is the sacred.

The mind will protest, of course. It says:
“But I can’t quiet the chatter,”
“I’ve tried meditation,”
“It’s too much — I’m too distracted.”

And yet, none of that changes the truth.
You are already here.
You have never once left the present.

The illusion lies in thinking that you need to do something special to be present — to reach some altered state, to silence the mind, to float above thought. But the truth is simpler. It is so simple, the ego finds it insulting.

Awareness does not need to fight thought.
It only needs to include it.

Even now — as thoughts arise — can you also notice the room around you? The texture of the air, the feeling of your clothes against your skin, the hum beneath sound?

Awareness is not opposed to thinking. It is the space in which thought happens. And the moment you notice that space, you are free.

Not in some grand, permanent way.
But in this moment — and what other kind is there?

This is why the far Eastern traditions have always pointed not toward belief, but toward practice. Toward quiet attention. Toward the ever-present truth that has no need of dogma.

In Zen Buddhism, practitioners for centuries have sat in zazen — “just sitting.” Not striving for enlightenment, not visualizing success, but sitting with full presence. Legs crossed, back upright, breath felt. When thoughts arise, they bow to them… and return. Not with force, but with stillness.

In Taoism, one is taught not to grasp the Tao, but to align with it. Through observation of nature, through effortless motion (wu wei), the Taoist practitioner learns not to escape the world, but to blend with its flow — to be water, not stone.

In Hindu yogic tradition, the sages spoke of dhyāna, meditative absorption — a deep, undistracted awareness of what is. The Upanishads, some of the oldest spiritual texts on Earth (over 2,500 years old), speak not of creating truth, but of remembering it. That the “seer” and “seen” are not two — and that the truth is known, not by thought, but by direct experience.

Even the practice of mindfulness (sati in Pali), central to early Buddhism over 2,600 years ago, was never about fixing yourself. It was about watching, clearly, what is here: body, breath, thought, sensation — all arising and passing in awareness.

These practices are not modern techniques. They are ancient remembrances. And they are not limited to monasteries or retreats. They can be done now. Here. As you are.

Try this:

As you walk, feel your feet making contact with the earth.

As you eat, taste — not just the flavor, but the texture, the temperature, the movement of chewing.

As you listen to someone speak, notice the silence in which their words appear.

As you breathe, do nothing to the breath. Just watch it arrive, and go.

This is not complicated. But it is rare.
Because it asks of you the one thing the ego cannot offer:
your full attention.

No commentary. No seeking. No improving.
Just being.
Fully. Now.

Like all things, with practice, ego death is possible.

But here is the paradox:
You cannot want it.
You cannot chase it.
The very desire to destroy the ego… is the ego in disguise.

It is not something you make happen.
It is something that falls away when no longer needed.

And that falling away doesn’t require mountaintops or monasteries.
It happens in kitchens and gardens. In conversations and silence.
In walking the dog. In forgetting yourself long enough to laugh.

The ego does not vanish in a flash of light.
It fades in the quiet glow of ordinary presence —
where nothing is being defended, and nothing is being improved.

You don’t have to kill the ego.
Just stop feeding it.

And even that isn’t something to try.
It’s something that happens… as you live.



Chapter Six
The Flow of Compassionate Action

After the striving ends, after the masks are seen through and gently set down, one might ask — What now?

If there is no separate self to improve, no future to grasp, no ego to defend… how then shall I live?

The answer, as always, is not a doctrine, but a direction.

You live, quite simply, in harmony.

Not according to a rule, but in alignment with the current of life itself — like a tree leaning toward sunlight, or a river curving around a stone. You live not as a reaction to the world, but as its expression.

This is the beginning of compassionate action — not as a virtue, but as a natural unfolding.

You are no longer trying to be kind. You are no longer weighing acts of goodness against some imagined scale. Instead, you begin to see that kindness, like water, flows from the unresisted heart.

This is the secret often missed in moral teachings:
It is not about trying to love.
It is about removing what blocks love from flowing.

And once the ego quiets, once the mind’s tight grasp loosens, love arises like breath — unforced and unclaimed.

But beware — ego has its counterfeit forms of love. It clings and controls, then calls it care. It sacrifices with resentment and calls it virtue. It demands attention, submission, gratitude, and calls it loyalty.

As Alan Watts once said:

“You can’t keep something caged and claim you love it. That’s not love — that’s possession.”

True love is not something you have. It’s something that has you.
It moves through you — toward others, toward the world — not because you ought to act, but because you’ve stopped holding back.

When you are no longer bound by identity or time or striving, you find yourself being gentle. You find yourself listening more, interrupting less. You find yourself softening to others’ pain — not as a performance, but as a reflection of your own once-felt hurt.

And the paradox is — you are doing nothing.
The cosmos is simply moving through you, as you.
A smile here. A helping hand there. A word withheld. A silence honoured.

There is a difference between intentional acts of kindness and the kindness that blooms from wholeness. The former can be beautiful, but it often comes with a price — the desire to be seen, to be repaid, to be acknowledged. The latter comes without asking. It is done and forgotten. It leaves no residue.

The flower does not bloom to impress the bee.
It blooms because blooming is its nature.
And in doing so, it nourishes everything.

You, too, are allowed that kind of living.

Not forced, not planned, not strategic —
but flowing, gentle, open-eyed.

Let this be the first step beyond the illusion of self:
not absence, but participation.
Not escape, but embrace.

To live as love — not as an idea, but as what remains when nothing is in the way.

But if love is the current, one might ask —
why does the world still hurt?

If there is no ego, no self to defend, and we are all simply flowing with the unfolding of the cosmos, then what of suffering? What of pain, of grief, of loss? Are these, too, just illusions?

Yes.
But not meaningless illusions.

The sages of the East have long said: the world is a dream — a divine projection. Māyā. Not false in the way a lie is false, but illusory in the way a shadow is not the object itself. It appears. It feels. It moves. But it does not endure. It is not the final truth.

And within this dream — this flickering field of form — suffering appears. Not as punishment. Not as flaw. But as part of the play.

It’s no more real than pleasure, but no less potent.

You see, we have been taught to think of suffering as a mistake — as something to fix, avoid, or rise above. But in truth, suffering is part of the texture of the dream. It is not something separate from joy. It is woven into it.

As the Taoists knew — and expressed so simply through the symbol of yin and yang — there is no light without shadow, no fullness without emptiness, no growth without decay. One gives rise to the other. They turn and return, endlessly.

In Taoist imagery, the dark contains a dot of light, and the light a dot of dark — each completing and feeding the other. It is not opposition. It is complement. This is not a cruel design — it is balance.

Pain and pleasure are not opposites. They are poles of the same vibration. What is soft can become sharp. What is sharp can melt into softness. To deny one is to deny the whole.

There is no wave that rises without also falling.
There is no inhale without exhale.
There is no front without back, no above without below.
The dream is made of contrast — and to live in harmony with it is not to escape it, but to surrender to its rhythm.

Suffering, in this light, is not a punishment. It is a reminder.
It calls you back to presence. It strips away what is false.
It humbles the ego and opens the heart.

And this does not mean we glorify suffering. Only that we understand it — not as something to be defeated, but as something to be embraced, when it comes, as part of the totality.

And so we meet our own pain not with resistance, but with curiosity. We listen to it. We feel it fully. We allow it to move through — just as we allow joy to visit and pass. Neither is permanent. Neither is truly “ours.”

All of this — the joy and the grief, the ease and the ache — belongs.
Even in the dream, it belongs.

And so too does what we call death.

But death is not the end. It is not a negation.
It is a change in form. A movement. A returning.

The body returns to the earth. The breath returns to the sky.
What you called “you” was never separate — it was always the movement of the whole.

And so, there is no real death. Only transformation.

No wave is lost when it crashes. It becomes the sea again.

This is not belief. This is not hope. It is simply how things are —
when you stop pretending they are not.

To live in this awareness is not to be without sorrow.
It is to walk through sorrow without losing your footing.

It is to say yes to the rain and the sun alike.
To trust that the darkness is not the enemy of the light,
but its necessary companion.

And in this trust — in this surrender to the totality —
love moves. Compassion flows. Presence remains.

You are not apart from it.
You are it



Chapter Seven
Just This

There is a curious thing that happens when you’ve seen through enough: the mind stops needing to understand.

Not because all the answers have been found, but because the questions no longer bite. They soften. They settle. They become leaves floating on the surface of a still pond.

You begin to see that you were never going anywhere — not spiritually, not personally, not cosmically. You were always here. There is nowhere else.

The path dissolves. The seeker disappears. And what remains?

Just this.

The breeze through the window.
The hum of your breath.
The way sunlight lands on a cracked floorboard.
The pause between two thoughts.

It turns out, awakening was never about becoming something. It was about not turning away from what already is.

No moment is more sacred than another.
No ritual is closer to truth than washing the dishes.
No teacher is greater than the silence between your thoughts.

You’ve heard talk of ego, time, the self, suffering, death. You’ve seen them from within and without. And now, perhaps, something has shifted — not in knowledge, but in orientation.

You’re no longer trying to hold anything. Not clarity. Not peace. Not even presence.
You simply rest.
Not because you’ve arrived, but because you see now — there was never anywhere else to be.

And so we return, at last, to the great unspoken truth of every mystic tradition:

You are the universe, knowing itself.

Not metaphorically. Not symbolically.
Literally.

You are not a fragment wandering through space. You are space itself, momentarily arranged in the form of a human being — reading, breathing, wondering. You are not inside the cosmos. The cosmos is expressing through you.

Every being you’ve ever met is also you, in another mask. Every star, every cell, every falling leaf — you.

This is why death is not an ending.
There is no death.
Only transformation.

The body dissolves. The story pauses.
But what you truly are was never born, and so it cannot die.

You are the field.
You are the dreamer of the dream.
You are awareness, wearing a thousand faces, seeing itself again and again across time, space, and form.

And when you see this — really see it — something quiet settles in the heart.

There is no need to escape this world.
There is no better world waiting.
There is only now.

Not a moment on a clock. Not a point in time.
But the eternal unfolding of what is.

You do not need to understand this.
You do not need to explain it.
You only need to live it.

And that is the end of the path —
not because the journey is over,
but because the notion of a journey has dissolved.

You rise. You breathe. You live.
And all of it is sacred.

Because it is Just This-the Great Unfolding.

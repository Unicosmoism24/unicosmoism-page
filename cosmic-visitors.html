    <h2>Cosmic Visitors</h2>
    <p>When we talk about Cosmic Oneness and Unity, that also includes our family from other worlds. In Unicosmoism, we believe that humans have been, and continue to be visited by extraterrestrial beings since the dawn of civilization, though they seem to wish to keep their presence unknown from the majority of Humanity. We may not be ready as a species for ET life to reveal itself to us, and that's why the Church of Cosmic Oneness focuses on readying Humanity for that official handshake. We believe there’s always a possibility that our cosmic brethren have directly and indirectly aided in our growth and advancement as a species, and evidence of that interaction may very well be recorded throughout various cultures around the world throughout history. Always remember: if everything came into existence from a single source, alien life is also part of the Cosmic Whole/Self.</p>
    <p>There are always going to be bad actors, and that applies to potential extraterrestrial visitors as well, who may have not yet evolved to understand their interconnectedness with the Universe. Perhaps some alien species are inherently war-hungry and primitive, like us. Perhaps they're also just a step above us technologically but have the same mentality as us, which could be potentially disastrous in a meeting. We must always be alert and vigilant, either way, but hope for the best.</p>
    <p>I believe that full disclosure may be very close, but I don't know wether that will be from world governments or the ET themselves. I do know that most of us are ready for the truth.</p>
    <p>I want to remind you that to join us, you do not have to believe that Earth is actively being visited, but if you’re here in the first place and interested in Unicosmoism, you probably already believe in E.T. visitations or that life exists elsewhere in the cosmos.</p>

    <h2>The Likelihood of Extraterrestrial Life</h2>
    <figure>

      <figcaption> Image credit: <a href="https://rubinobservatory.org/gallery/collections/first-look-gallery/mlis3sriah6pn6nfr5ecp46h3i" target="_blank">Rubin Observatory</a> </figcaption> 
    </figure>

    <h2 style="border:none; text-shadow:none; font-size:1.5rem;">Is there anybody out there?</h2> 
    <p>We cannot be alone in the cosmos. It is physically and mathematically impossible.</p> 
    <p>Above is an image taken in 2025 by the new Vera Rubin Observatory. The Rubin Observatory is a next‑generation telescope built high in the mountains of Chile. What makes it special isn’t just its size - it’s the way it watches the sky. Instead of taking a few long exposures like most telescopes, Rubin takes rapid, wide‑angle snapshots of the entire sky again and again, all night long.</p> 
    <p>It uses the largest digital camera ever built, capturing images so wide and detailed that it can spot anything that changes: new asteroids, exploding stars, objects drifting through space, or subtle shifts in distant galaxies. Over the next decade, it will create a kind of cosmic time‑lapse, collecting more data in a single year than all other optical observatories combined.</p> 
    <p>The image above, nicknamed the “Cosmic Treasure Chest,” shows a small part of the Virgo Cluster. It covers an area of sky only about eight full Moons wide — a region that looks almost empty to the naked eye. Through a powerful wide‑field telescope, that same patch reveals hundreds of galaxies and details that have never been seen before in human history.</p> 
    <p>In that one tiny slice of sky, about the length of an adult’s forearm held out at arm’s length, there are billions upon billions of stars and galaxies. And that doesn’t include the ones too faint or too distant to appear in the image — those tiny smudges that look like single fuzzy pixels, and whatever lies beyond them.</p> 
    <p>While you view the image, I want you to pay attention to each spiral galaxy you see and understand how each one contains millions and billions of stars, depending on the galaxy’s size. Stars just like our very own Sun, and countless other star varieties of all shapes, sizes, temperatures, and brightnesses. Stars are the power plants of the Universe and allow for certain life to flourish, as seen on our Earth.</p> 
    <p>Not all life requires starlight and some creatures and microbes can be found deep under the oceans near thermal volcanic vents on the seafloor, but volcanism is just another symptom of a planet with a star. Without the host star’s gravity, even plate tectonics that heat up the ground and oceans will cease to be, causing the molten core of the Earth to eventually cool down and solidify.</p> 
    <p>Now, all of this isn’t to say that life ONLY exists on worlds with an active star, and I would ultimately believe that to be a foolish assumption, since we don’t even know how to properly define life as we currently see it on our own world. For all we know, there could be plasmoid beings consisting entirely of focused energy (which is basically what we Humans are, but most don’t realize it).</p> 
    <p>The real question ends up going from “Is there life out there?” to “I wonder who our closest cosmic neighbors are?”, which opens the next section.</p> 

    <h2>Are we being visited?</h2> 
    <p>This is probably the number one question that most modern folks have about aliens. Even just thirty-years-ago, one would be ridiculed and looked down upon if they claimed to have seen a UFO or an ET. Even people who believed in visitation would keep it to themselves. Luckily, we’re now living in a period where science and philosophy are coming together and meeting in the middle.</p> 
    <p>Mainstream organized religion usually frowns upon discussion of extraterrestrial life, sometimes outright refusing to even acknowledge the subject, and sometimes replacing ‘alien’ with ‘demon’ when it is brought up.</p> 
    <p>I personally know many Christians who cannot accept the idea of alien beings from other planets, simply because they feel that it will invalidate their beliefs and prove their denomination’s teachings as false, which is the leading reason why most established religions steer away from alien talk. If you’ve been telling people for thousands of years that we’re special and chosen... and then you come down and destroy that entire lie, people start to rebel.</p> 
    <p>There have been detailed descriptions of Human/Alien contact throughout our recorded history, and even indigenous peoples will tell how their ancestors 10,000 years ago painted “star beings” on canyon walls in the American Southwest, still visible today, only for archeologists to come along and claim the “star beings” are actually just ceremonial depictions of costumes and head gear.</p> 
    <p>I personally feel that if ET beings wanted to be known, they'd have no problem showing themselves. It may boil down to Humanity not being mature and mentally/spiritually evolved enough for mass-disclosure. If that's the case, Unicosmists should help ready Humanity to make that official cosmic handshake.</p> 
    <p style="text-align: center;"><em>"In Unicosmoism, we approach everything with an open mind and will never dismiss something outright unless we have irrefutable proof. We know that in this infinite Universe, anything is possible."</em></p> 

    <h2>The Betty and Barney Hill Incident</h2>
    <p>One of the most famous cases of alien-human interaction happened in September 1961 about an hour from where I grew up, and I've visited the site several times. A couple named Betty and Barney Hill were driving through the White Mountains of New Hampshire after a vacation in Canada when they noticed a strange light following their car not far from the Indian Head Resort. Barney eventually got out with binoculars and saw a pancake shaped craft hovering low. He even reported seeing figures looking back at him from windows. After Betty became distressed over the craft, she urged Barney to get back in the car, which he eventually did. In a panic, she has him drive away as fast as he can and they head in the direction of home seeming leaving the craft behind, though it remained visible for a while and was almost like it was following them. At some point on the drive home they both realize they're missing about 2 hours of time that they can't recall no matter how hard they try.</p>

    <p>The physical clues were just as strange. Their watches had stopped working-forever. There were weird shiny spots on the trunk of their car that made a compass needle spin wildly. Betty even found a strange pinkish powder on her dress that wasn't there prior. Later on, they underwent hypnosis with a psychiatrist named Dr. Benjamin Simon to recover their memories. They described being taken aboard a craft for medical exams by beings with grey skin and large eyes. During this, Betty was shown a star map that she later drew from memory. Years later, an amateur astronomer named Marjorie Fish matched it to the Zeta Reticuli star system. Whether you see it as a true physical encounter, a hoax or a deep psychological event shared between two people, the Hill incident remains the most famous and talked about ET encounter to this day Being that it happened so close to where I lived half of my life, it has always deeply fascinated and interested me. I can't help but believe something did indeed happen to them that night.</p>

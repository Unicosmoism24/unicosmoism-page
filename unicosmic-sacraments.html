  <!-- Your Introduction -->
  <p style="color:#d0eaff; font-family:'Palatino Linotype',Palatino,serif; margin-bottom:1.5rem;">
    <strong>Meditation Exercise</strong><br>
    Below you will find a simple meditation to help ground you to your inner self and the world around you. If you need help with visual focus, there is an animated pulsing spiral with adjustable speed located under the meditation.
  </p>

  <ol style="list-style-position: inside; color:#d0eaff; line-height:1.6;">
    <li>
      <strong>Posture</strong><br>
      Sit on a firm surface with your spine straight and shoulders relaxed. Rest your hands lightly on your thighs and close your eyes.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Settling</strong><br>
      Draw attention to the natural rhythm of your breath. Inhale—feel your ribs expand. Exhale—notice your chest soften.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Guided Cycles</strong><br>
      <ul style="margin:0.5rem 0 1rem 1.5rem; list-style-type: disc;">
        <li><em>Inhale (count to 4):</em> Draw in the universe’s quiet energy.</li>
        <li><em>Hold (count to 2):</em> Remain steady and still.</li>
        <li><em>Exhale (count to 6):</em> Release tension completely.</li>
        <li><em>Pause (count to 2):</em> Rest before the next cycle.</li>
      </ul>
      Repeat for five full cycles, keeping each breath measured.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Inner Focus</strong><br>
      Visualize the <em>Celestial Triad Spiral</em> at the center of your mind—earth, sun, and moon in balance. With each inhale, imagine it turning; with each exhale, let thoughts orbit and drift away.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Mantra (optional)</strong><br>
      Silently repeat, “I am one with the cosmic tide,” in time with your breath.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Closing</strong><br>
      After the last exhale, bring awareness back to your body. Open your eyes gently and bow in gratitude to the universe.
    </li>
  </ol>
